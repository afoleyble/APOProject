Test plan - APOProject:

Setup and requirements:
APO will not work without proper register keys and audio device configuration. Without this don't even try to test anything.
The future instalator should automatically create the proper conditions for APO to work.

Testing:
1. Try to use values for all variables available that are outside the safe zone or can be dangerous for APO work and/or for headphones/speakers to see the behavior.
2. Try to mix all possible effects and its extreme values in order to spot any undesirable distortions.
3. Try to use the APO normally for some time to eventually spot some bugs in the natural way.
4. Try to use multiple applications creating audio stream to see whether the APO can handle it or not.
