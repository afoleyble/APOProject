Test plan - APOProject:

Setup and requirements:
APO will not work without proper register keys and audio device configuration. Without this don't even try to test anything.
The instalator should automatically create the proper conditions for APO to work.

Testing: manual, except "Benchmark", which automatically will process a sample sine sweep with acoustic frequencies.
0. Use "Benchmark.exe" to test whether .dll library of APO is built and is processing audio stream properly.
1. Try to use values for all variables/effects available that are outside the safe zone or can be dangerous for APO work 
and/or for headphones/speakers to see the behavior and test whether the APO is preventing this from damage.
2. Try to mix all possible effects and their extreme values in order to spot any undesirable distortions 
and/or significant delays in playing sound.
3. Try to use the APO normally for some time to eventually spot some bugs/issues/crashes in the natural way of using.
4. Try to use multiple applications creating audio stream to see whether the APO can handle it or not.
5.
