Test plan and results - APOProject:

Setup and requirements:
APO will not work without proper register keys and audio device configuration. Without this don't even try to test anything.
The instalator should automatically create the proper conditions for APO to work.

Testing: manual, except "Benchmark", which automatically will process a sample sine sweep with acoustic frequencies.
0. Use installer for different processor architecture (i.e. 32-bit installer for 64-bit processor).
Result - alert and aborting installation - passed.
1. Use "Benchmark.exe" to test whether .dll library of APO is built and is processing audio stream properly. 
Result - lines with parameters about test - passed.
2. Use different values for effects that are outside the safe zone or can be dangerous for APO work 
and/or for headphones/speakers to see the behavior and test whether the APO is preventing this from damage. 
Result - APO works fine in every case, but there no protection from high gain levels (only red colour in graph) - half-passed.
3. Use multiple applications creating audio stream to see whether the APO can handle it or not.
Result - using different software audio sources (audio player, web browser, games, Windows sounds) revealed no strange behaviour - passed.
4. Use the APO normally for some time to eventually spot some bugs/issues/crashes in the natural way of using.
Result - after three weeks of normal use (different audio sources/output devices/APO settings) APO caused no troubles at all - passed.
