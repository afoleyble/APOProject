# APOProject
A trial of developing a APO (Audio Processing Object), working on Windows 7/8/8.1/10.

The APO lets you to modify audio stream in many ways, in order to improve user's entertainment.
You can use equalizers, gain limiters/amplifiers, band-pass and band-stop filters, convolution signals and more.
Everything is easy to install, test and configure thanks to instalator, auto-test, configurator and effect editor.

It works for both 32-bit or 64-bit processors and systems (both binary releases-instalators in the "Releases" section).
For more information (including the developing one) head into "Wiki" section.
